# Inventory Management Sprint 13

## Tech Stack
For back-end, we use:
- Django: back-end server
- GCP Compute Engine: where web app hosted
- Email Notification and Food Freshness Detection Python Scripts

For Front-end side:
- Bootstrap: providing style thing
- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript: handle dynamic elements
- 
## web development
Basically I have three parts: _stock management_, _food freshness_ and _donation_. I've done with creating a homepage to navigate the three separate apps. For food freshness and and donation, the pages has been created.

## Integrate back-end and front-end

### Deal with database migrate

> error message: Unknown command: "squall"

This is caused by `squall` has been deprecated since Django 1.9, currently we use Django 3.0.8. To solve this, do the following commands:

```
python3 manage.py makemigrations your_app_name
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py sqlmigrate freshness 0001
```

### How to connect MySQL database through Django Shell

First you'll need to configure the database's name, host, password in `settings.py` under your apps

Type following command to invoke Django Shell:
```
Python3 manage.py shell
```

Then type your command to the shell:
```
>>> from Django.db import connection
>>> cursor = connection.cursor()
>>> cursor.execute('SELECT item FROM freshness_food ORDER BY item')
>>> print(cursor.fetchall())
```
*above is just an example*
